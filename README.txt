## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about HTML semantic. While I was doing the project, I maked several searchs about all the tags and the best uses cases for they. Then I tried applicate in the best way possible in the project. I think this helped me a learn about the semantic.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about HTML semantic to have a solid knowlegde about that and I can use tags without the doubt its the correct use or not. I also want to learn more about CSS too, about Flexbox and other features to create beautiful and optimized sites.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - Obvious, the best site to learn how to use each tag.
