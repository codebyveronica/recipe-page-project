## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about HTML semantics. While doing the project, I did a lot of research on all the tags and the best use cases for them. So I tried to apply it in the best way possible in the project. I think this helped me learn about semantics.

### Continuous development

I want to continue learning about the semantics of HTML to have a solid understanding of it and be able to use tags without doubting whether it is the correct usage or not. I also want to learn more about CSS, Flexbox and other resources to create beautiful and optimized websites.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - The best site to learn about the use of each tag.
